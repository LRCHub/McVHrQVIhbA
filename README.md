[00:53.70] I have a big gun
[00:55.32] I took it from my lord
[00:56.99] Sleep with justice
[00:58.26] I just wanna feel you
[01:00.52] I'm your angel
[01:02.03] Only a ring away
[01:03.85] You make me violate you
[01:05.30] No matter who you are
[01:14.01] It's all up to you
[01:15.64] No one lives forever
[01:17.20] Been burn in the hell
[01:18.94] By all those pigs out there
[01:20.72] It's always been hell
[01:22.37] From when i was born
[01:23.91] They make me violate them
[01:25.53] No matter who they are
[01:33.82] Get down on your knees
[01:35.33] Get a good head on your shoulders
[01:37.11] If it's for your guys
[01:38.64] Go to the end of the earth
[01:40.58] Do what you think
[01:42.00] Give it with dedication
[01:43.98] I'll put out your misery
[02:14.68] Have no prayer
[02:16.35] So, i keep the gun with me
[02:17.94] For my safety
[02:19.79] I'll do it with no sweat
[02:21.44] They mean business
[02:23.01] No time for sissy pig
[02:24.79] Queen of ocean
[02:26.35] Sing "the volga" to you
[02:38.22] No need to think about it
[02:40.02] You do it or you die
[02:41.84] Those aren't tears
[02:43.49] Don't let it trick on you
[02:45.24] I am hard as steel
[02:46.68] Get out of my way
[02:48.44] Pay back all at once
[02:50.14] Suck away the tender part
[02:51.69] You made a mess
[02:53.19] For christ sake, this rotten world
[02:55.05] Shit out of luck
[02:56.64] Go with my vision
[02:58.31] Light up the fire
[03:00.03] Right on the power
[03:01.56] Weapon... i have it all
[03:59.25] Get down on your knees
[04:00.95] Get a good head on your shoulders
[04:02.60] If it's for your guys
[04:04.16] Go to the end of the earth
[04:05.90] Do what you think
[04:07.49] Give it with dedication
[04:09.46] I'll put out your misery
[04:12.88] You made a mess
[04:14.37] For christ sake, this rotten world
[04:16.12] Shit out of luck
